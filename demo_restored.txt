CryptoKit Phase 1 - New .txt Extension Demo

This file will be encrypted using AES-128 and will create a .txt encrypted file that can be opened in any text editor (though it will show binary content).

The key advantages of using .txt extension:
1. Files can be opened in any text editor
2. No special software needed to view (though content is encrypted)
3. Better compatibility across different systems
4. Easier file management and identification
