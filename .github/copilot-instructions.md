# CryptoKit (CK) - Cryptography Toolkit

This is a comprehensive cryptography toolkit built in Python for Linux systems.

## Project Structure
- Modular architecture with separate modules for each cryptographic function
- CLI-based interface with extensible command system
- External tool integration (John the Ripper, Hashcat)
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## Development Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 coding standards
- Use type hints for all functions
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write unit tests for all modules
- Document all functions with docstrings

## Key Features
1. Symmetric Encryption/Decryption
2. File/Directory Hashing
3. Hash Cracking with external tools
4. Steganography (images, text, binary)
5. File Metadata Analysis

## Current Status
âœ… Project infrastructure setup complete
âœ… Core framework (config, logging, interfaces) implemented
âœ… CLI structure with interactive mode created
âœ… Phase 1: Foundation ready for encryption implementation
ðŸŸ¡ Phase 1: Symmetric Encryption - Ready to implement
ðŸ”´ Phase 2: Hashing & Integrity Verification - Planned
ðŸ”´ Phase 3: Hash Analysis & Cracking - Planned
ðŸ”´ Phase 4: Steganography - Planned
ðŸ”´ Phase 5: File Metadata & Analysis - Planned

## Next Steps
1. Test the basic CLI functionality
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation (symmetric encryption)
3. Set up development environment with required dependencies
